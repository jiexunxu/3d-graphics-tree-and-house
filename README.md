# 3d-graphics-tree-and-house

Final project of Computer Graphics course from my college. Everything in the project (camera, lighting, geometric shapes etc) was built from scratch, no external libraries used. It's a good experience to learn the barebones of how computer graphics work (lighting, camera, transformations, rotations etc)

Project was originally created in Java Applet, but have been recently migrated to a Java application. MainScene.java has a main() method, which is the starting point of this project.

The scene consist of a house, some chairs and tables, and a tree with 3d leaves and flowers that moves with wind. The project is in a day-night cycle. As the time of the day changes, lighting direction and intensity also changes. Night time stars are visible.

The prject is interactive. Press W, A, S or D to move the camera, I, J, K or L to rotate the camera. Press - to decrease wind strength, = to increase wind strength. Press SPACE to reset camera.
